Wait for the game to jumble all objects and display a card. Then identify the object displayed on the card and pick the same object from the clutter of objects behind. You can drag the card around to see the objects which are behind the card. Click on the Green button if you want to pass. Once all 20 items are identified, you will see a Thumbs up emoji display card. To keep playing, click on the blue button. The number of times you have finished identifying the set of 20 objects will be displayed on the bottom right of the screen.
